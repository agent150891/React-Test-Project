## React Test Project

A simple test project created by using React.
The purpose of the project is to show a demonstration of working with various interface elements.

The first element is the "Find a job" button. By clicking on it you make the next element, a data form, visible.
After the click, the button become disabled.

The form element contains a cross icon to close it, three input fields and a button to submit data. All the inputs
are validated - if the input information is incorrect, a warning message will appear.

The app is also has a fluid design, adapted to multiple mobile devices.
